        <h1>Freelancing</h1>
        <h2>Introduction: What is Freelancing?</h2>
         <img src="imgs/freelancerintro.jpg" alt="Free lancer">
        <p> In medieval times when knights roamed the land and fighting was done on horseback with a long pole known as a lance, the mercenaries of the time were referred to as 'free lances'. </p>
        <p> Today freelancing typically refers to writers, designers, programmers and so on. Freelancers are people who offer their services to employers without a long term commitment to them. They often charge by the hour, day or job and are essentially one person businesses.
        </p>
        <p> The business conditions necessary to freelance differ around the world, but typically include some sort of business registration and tax setup to charge for your services. The main prerequisites to becoming a freelancer however are a high level of skill in your field and drive. Once you are out on your own there is no longer the shelter of senior employees to correct your mistakes or cover your faults. Freelancers are typically very well rounded in their skills as they need to operate as a one person team. 
        </p>
        <p> Beyond the basic regulatory conditions, the desire to freelance and the skill level required there are a variety of details that you need to consider from branding to rates, client liaison to the mechanics of accounting. This article will walk you through some of these.

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <img src="imgs/brandyourself.jpg" alt="Free lancer">
        <p> One of the first things you will need to do as a freelancer is decide on a brand for yourself. It might be your name 'John Smith Design' or something more grand 'Eclipse Programming Services'. Whatever it is you will need a business identity to work under and for clients to know you as. </p>
        <p> Along with your new name you will naturally need a logo, business cards and a website. Remember that you are now a business and all your materials need to be polished and professional. It's nice to be personal, but don't let your hobbies, rants or photos into the picture, particularly on your website. </p>
        <p> If you're not a designer yourself, invest the money in someone who knows what they are doing as the difference is immeasurable and the impact of looking professional can make the crucial difference when your potential client hasn't yet had the chance to know you by your quality of work. </p>
        <p> When it comes to your website, make sure you get a domain name that is: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Easy to remember. Really long domains can be confusing, as can ones with odd acronyms or letters in them</li>
            <li> Easy to spell. If you have to say your web or email address over the phone it's always better if you don't have to say it letter by letter with things like dashes or underscores mixed in.</li>
            <li> Appropriately descriptive. A name that says something or ties in with your name or business name is best. Its easy to remember and immediately identifies you.</li>
        </ol> 
        
        <p>Make no mistake, having a website and particularly a domain name is essential. Freelancing off a hotmail account just does not come across as professional or serious and impressions count. When it comes to building your website, there are a few key pieces of information that must be on there, they are: An introduction of some sort - usually just a statement is best Your services, or else how will anyone know what you do? Examples of your previous work Contact details You may wish to make more of your site, work on search engine optimization or make it part of your workflow process, but for the bare minimum those four items will suffice.

        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <img src="imgs/marketyourself.jpg" alt="Free lancer">
        <p>The key to getting started as a freelancer is to have work. But where do you find your first jobs and indeed your later jobs too? And what do you put in your portfolio if everything you've ever done belongs to your old employers?
        </p>

        <p>FreelanceSwitch offers a job board which is hand-moderated so you only see the legitimate jobs that meet our standards. It's free to post jobs and $7 per month to apply to them, and get priority listing in our freelancer directory.
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to getting your first job, its really a matter of using your contacts, and that means telling everyone you know that you are available for hire. If you do not have many leads then you will also want to make sure they know that you'll come cheap. It might be a good idea to send a mailer around to family and friends, or you might prefer to talk to people in person, whatever the case remember, no-one will hire you if no-one knows about you.
        </p>

        <p>You can often also find jobs on the web on forums and job boards. Look for local sites as well as international ones. Here are some examples of places you could look:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>FreelanceSwitch Jobs</li>
        <li>37Signals' Gig board</li>
        <li>Krop</li>
        <li>Australian INfront</li>
        <li>Coroflot</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Another good starting point for work are places that you have worked at before or where you know someone who works. Two of my own first clients were former employers who had overflow work. It padded out the portfolio and helped me ride out the lean early months.
        </p>

        <p>If you have nothing to show for yourself for whatever reason then you had either better be a great talker or find something to put as a sample. This might mean:
        </p>
        <ol>   
        <li>Creating an imaginary job for yourself and executing</li>
        <li>Offering your services for free to someone</li>
        <li>Talking your last employer into allowing you to show some of your old work for a specific period of time</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In any case it's difficult for a client to hire you on the strength of your word alone. From time to time you will be asked to do what is known as free pitching, where the potential client will ask you to do some of the work prior to payment. My view is that this devalues your industry and indicates the potential client does not place much worth on your work. Consider if you went to see a doctor, would you ask for a sample health check free of charge, or would you get your mechanic to start fixing your car to see if you liked the way he worked? These things tend to happen in creative fields such as design and writing, but they should not. Keep these thoughts in mind, particularly in your early days when you are struggling.
        </p>

        <p>Once you have worked a fair amount of jobs, you should find that you steadily get an increase in repeat work and referral work and that you depend less and less on new jobs. If this is not the case you are either too expensive, getting the wrong types of clients or not good enough at your work (which in turn means you're too expensive). You can and should generally anyway look for outside ways to get more work - advertising, yellow pages listings, getting your website found and so on, but if you have trouble retaining your clients or having them refer you on, then these are cosmetic fixes and you should be looking at addressing the main problem.
